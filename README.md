## Challenge Overview

### 1. Dynamic Rule Engine

**Goal:** Create a system that dynamically checks if a user can perform a given action based on JSON rules stored in the database.

**Key Features:**

* `RuleEvaluator` class to evaluate JSON rules against a `User` model.
* Supported operators: `==`, `!=`, `in`, `not_in`, `>`, `<`, `contains`.
* Uses PHP Reflection or Laravel helper functions.

**Example JSON:**

```json
{
  "action": "submit_form",
  "rules": [
    { "field": "role", "operator": "==", "value": "staff" },
    { "field": "email_verified_at", "operator": "!=", "value": null }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Nested Eloquent Search Filter

**Goal:** Build a flexible filter class that accepts JSON filters and applies them across multiple relationships.

**Key Features:**

* Works on base queries (e.g., `Appointment::query()`).
* Supports dot notation for nested relationships.
* Handles `where`, `whereHas`, `orWhereHas`, with fallback to `where`.
* Includes unit tests to verify SQL generation.

**Example JSON:**

```json
{
  "patient.name": "John",
  "appointment.status": "confirmed",
  "location.city": "Dallas"
}
```

### 3. State Machine for Models

**Goal:** Implement a lightweight State Machine as a trait for Eloquent models.

**Key Features:**

* Static `$states` array defining allowed transitions.
* `transitionTo(string $newState)` method for validating and triggering transitions.
* Fires `ModelTransitioning` and `ModelTransitioned` events.

**Example:**

```php
public static $states = [
    'draft'     => ['submitted'],
    'submitted' => ['approved', 'rejected'],
    'approved'  => [],
];
```

---

## Testing

```bash
php artisan test
```

Tests cover:

* Rule Engine evaluation.
* Nested filter SQL generation.
* State transition validation and event firing.

---

## Notes

* Prioritizes clean code, scalability, and Laravel best practices.
* Components are reusable and extendable.
